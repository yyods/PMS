# PMS Project

This repository contains the PMS (Project Management System) project, which is structured into two main components:

1. **ChromeExtension**: A browser extension for collecting data and exporting it as a `.csv` file.
2. **Processing**: A Python script for processing the `.csv` file to identify the status of each record.

### ChromeExtension

The **ChromeExtension** directory contains the implementation of a Chrome browser extension that enables users to collect data from a web page and export it to a `.csv` file.

- **background.js**: Implements background scripts for the extension, handling events and managing data processing.
- **manifest.json**: The manifest file for defining the extension's metadata and permissions.
- **popup.html**: The user interface for interacting with the extension.
- **popup.js**: Script to handle user interactions and export data.

For more details on how to set up and use the Chrome extension, refer to the `README.md` in the ChromeExtension directory.

### Processing

The **Processing** directory includes a Python script for analyzing and processing the `.csv` files generated by the Chrome extension.

- **checking.py**: This script takes a `.csv` file as input, processes each record, and identifies the status for each.

> Note: The `.csv` files (e.g., input and output) are excluded from the repository using `.gitignore`.

For more details on how to run the processing script, refer to the `README.md` in the Processing directory.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Google Chrome for running the Chrome extension.
- Python 3.x for running the processing script.

### Installation

#### Chrome Extension

1. Open the Chrome browser and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
2. Enable **Developer mode** in the top-right corner.
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `PMS` folder inside the `ChromeExtension` directory.

#### Processing Script

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Install any necessary Python libraries (if required by `checking.py`).

### Usage

#### Using the Chrome Extension

1. Load the extension in Chrome as described above.
2. Use the extension to collect data from web pages.
3. Export the collected data as a `.csv` file.

#### Running the Processing Script

1. Place the exported `.csv` file into the `Processing` directory.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python checking.py
   ```
3. Check the `out.csv` file for the processed results.
